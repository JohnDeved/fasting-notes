# Fasting Notes
to keep my mind fresh with my research

things I remember from researching some time ago about fasting and keto that I need to research and fact-check again.
I will edit and mark every line with ☑︎ and linking to the resource I fact-checked it with.

## weight (fat) loss
- Short-term fasting on ketosis (5 days or so) is a good and healthy way to lose fat.
  - fasting can make you lose 500g of fat a day.
- many "traditional" weight loss methods are way harder and can cause your metabolism to suffer (the biggest-loser effect).
  - Short-term fasting does not seem to cause a significant metabolic slowdown or muscle loss compared to continuous calorie restriction.
- [☑︎](https://blog.thefastingmethod.com/fasting-and-muscle-mass-fasting-part-14/) Fasting-induced ketosis makes you lose almost only fat. (losing less muscle or bone mass.)
  - [☑︎](https://blog.thefastingmethod.com/fasting-and-muscle-mass-fasting-part-14/) Fasting preserves lean body mass by stimulating growth hormone and reducing protein breakdown.
  - [☑︎ Dr. Jason Fung, MD](https://www.dietdoctor.com/fasting-affects-physiology-hormones) writes: Long term studies Proof [...] the fasting strategy is more than 4 times better at preserving lean mass percentage compared to caloric restriction.

## Positive side effects
- [☑︎](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/ketosis#:~:text=Ketosis%20is%20a%20metabolic%20state%20in%20which%20your%20body%20uses%20fat%20and%20ketones%20rather%20than%20glucose%20(sugar)%20as%20its%20main%20fuel%20source.) In ketosis, Fat becomes the body's primary energy source.
  - Fat is a "better" source of energy for the brain than glucose, which makes you more focused, able, and smarter.
- [☑︎](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/ketosis#:~:text=Established%20benefits%3A-,Appetite%20regulation,-%3A%20One%20of) Fasting-induced Ketosis reduces ghrelin (appetite hormone), making you feel less hungry.
- Fasting positively affects the growth hormone
  - which is a hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration. 
  - the growth hormone also has anti-aging, anti-obesity, and muscle-sparing effects.
  - Fasting can increase growth hormone levels by up to 5-fold in men and 13-fold in women.
- [☑︎](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990470/)[☑︎](https://casereports.bmj.com/content/casereports/2018/bcr-2017-221854.full.pdf) Fasting is a good way to heal and prevent diabetic type 2.
  - ☑︎ Fasting can improve glucose control, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function in people with type 2 diabetes.
  - [☑︎ Dr. Bret Scher, MD](https://www.dietdoctor.com/intermittent-fasting-the-best-diet-for-type-2-diabetes): [...] Intermittent fasting combined with a low carb diet may be the best treatment of type 2 diabetes that we have ever seen.
- Fasting positively affects the long-term immune system.
  - Fasting can modulate the immune system in various ways, such as reducing inflammation, enhancing autophagy, stimulating stem cell regeneration, and altering gut microbiota.
  - These effects can potentially improve the immune response to infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and cancer 
- [☑︎](https://josepheverettwil.substack.com/p/how-fasting-changes-testosterone) Fasting positively affects the testosterone hormone in men (after the fast).
- Autophagy is activated by fasting, as it provides an alternative source of energy and nutrients for the cells.
  - Autophagy can be described as a kind of "maintenance" mode,  "cleaning" the system.
  - Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the degradation and recycling of damaged or unnecessary components, such as proteins, organelles, and pathogens.
  - Autophagy can protect against aging, inflammation, infection, cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders. 
  - [☑︎](https://www.wefast.care/articles/fasting-loose-skin#:~:text=Autophagy%20and%20loose%20skin) Autophagy can help mitigate loose skin from forming and may even improve existing loose skin.

## general notes
- ketogenic eating to reach higher levels of ketosis before you start water fasting is a great and healthy way to mitigate most bad side effects you encounter in the first few days of fasting.
- starting a fast without being in ketosis is harder and bad for the body, since you have to suffer though low blood suggars for the first few days. (more muscle than fat loss, low energy, bad feeling)
- you should drink plenty of water while fasting, 40% of all water the body consumes usually comes from food. So it can be easier to not drink enough and dehydrate when you fast since you need to drink more water than usual.
  - you should listen to your body. dry lips for example are a typical sign of dehydration.

## some potential dangers
- keto-flu can be a problem for beginners. What causes it and how to prevent it?
  - Listen to your body. If you ever get hungry or feel sick/bad during a fast, you should abort.
- you should always keep your minerals in check. Using the right amount of supplements in the right way is an important thing to keep in mind.
  - there are 3 important minerals: sodium, magnesium, and potassium (in German kalium).
  - Some minerals are fat-soluble, which means they need fat to be absorbed by the body. These minerals include vitamins A, D, E, and K.
  - However, Sodium, magnesium, and potassium are water-soluble minerals, which means they do not need fat to be absorbed by the body.
- [☑︎](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8IGRyTdrOs) you need to balance fasting with refeeding and nourishing your body. Just like you can overtrain with exercise, you can over-fast.
  - the most healthy way to do a fast for losing weight is doing a few days of fasting followed by short breaks. This allows your body to rest and does not ever put you at risk of mineral depletion or refeeding syndrome.
- [☑︎](https://youtu.be/k1OMGDnGpIk?t=640) ending your fast healthy is important. after longer times of fasting, the refeeding syndrome can even be deadly.
  - [☑︎](https://youtu.be/k1OMGDnGpIk?t=677) You should end every fast with a light low-fat meal without carbs.
  - a light meal that is easy to digest and does not cause a sudden spike in blood sugar or insulin levels.

## clearing up common missunderstandings
- "starvation mode" is a myth and fasting does not trigger it or anything like it.
- "yo-yo effect" is a misunderstanding of destroying your metabolism with some bad "traditional" weight loss methods.
- no, you are not "starving" yourself while fasting, under the right conditions the body is very capable of using the resources it has available.
   - there is a reason the body stores excessive available energy as fat in the first place, ketosis, and fasting enables you to use it.
   - eating carbs somewhat "blocks" the body from effectively using its fat storage, which is why modern-day high-carb and low-fiber (processed carbs, sugar) foods cause so many overweight people.
   - this causes the dilemma of people being extremely overweight that are still hungry. which is not how the body is supposed to function.
   - overweight people basically have an overflow of available energy that they can't use. Which in some ironic twisted way makes them have too much energy, but also constantly starve for more energy.
  - why do carbs cause this? the body is not evolved to digest highly processed carbs like we consume today.
  - why does this not affect everyone? this is sadly highly dependent on your genetics. some people deal with processed carbs way better than others.
  - this makes it way harder for some people to maintain their weight.
- High cholesterol was blamed for causing heart diseases. Nowadays this is a highly debatable topic and has been disproven by some studies.
  - many doctors don't belive that high levels of cholesterol have any bad effects on the human body.
  - that said, a ketogenic is going to increase your body's cholesterol.
