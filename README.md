# fasting-notes
to keep my mind fresh with my research

things I remember from researching some time ago about fasting and keto that I need to research and fact-check again:

## weight (fat) loss
- ketogenic eating to reach higher levels of ketosis before you start water fasting is a great and healthy way to mitigate most bad side effects you encounter in the first few days of fasting.
- Starting a fast without being in ketosis is bad for the body, for the first few days. (more muscle than fat loss, low blood sugar levels, low energy, bad feeling)
- at the peak of effectiveness, fasting can make you lose 500g of fat a day.
- Short-term fasting on ketosis (5 days or so) is the best and healthiest way to lose fat. Traditional methods are way harder and destroy your metabolism (the biggest-loser effect).

## positive side effects
- In ketosis, Fat becomes the body's primary energy source. Fat is a better source of energy for the brain than glucose, which makes you more focused, able, and smarter.
- Fasting positively affects the growth hormone
- Fasting positively affects the testosterone hormone in men.
- Fasting is one of the best ways to heal and prevent diabetic type 2.
- Fasting positively affects the long-term immune system.
- after a day or two of fasting you reach a state called "Autophagy". which is extremely healthy for the body.
- in Autophagy the body goes into a kind of "maintenance" mode. Since there is no food being processed, it can concentrate on "cleaning" the system.
- Autophagy also focuses on recycling some "trash" body parts for energy. This includes stuff like loose skin. 
- Autophagy makes fasting one of the best ways to improve a loose skin condition (if you have one). Or prevent loose skin from forming at all while looking at weight.

## some potential dangers
- keto-flu can be a problem for beginners. What causes it and how to prevent it?
- Listen to your body. If you ever get hungry or feel sick/bad during a fast, you should abort.
- you should always keep your minerals in check. Using the right amount of supplements in the right way is an important thing to keep in mind.
- there are 3 important minerals: sodium, magnesium, and potassium (in German kalium).
- the most healthy way to do a fast for losing weight is doing a few days of fasting followed by short breaks. This allows your body to rest and does not ever put you at risk of mineral depletion or refeeding syndrome.
- fasting over 7 days is dangerous because of depleted minerals.
- mineral supplement intake is only effective if you give the body some fat to absorb the nutrients. (oil, butter, avocado, nuts?)
- correctly replenishing minerals is the most important thing to get right when fasting. Otherwise, it can be very dangerous for the body.
- Fasting induces ketosis makes you lose almost only fat within a healthy timeframe. it's way more efficient in ONLY losing fat than all other methods.
- ending your fast healthy is important. after long times of fasting (a month or so), the refeeding syndrome can be deadly.
- you should end a long fast with light meals without carbs.
- long fasts can be bad for your long-term metabolism?
- TLDR: just don't do fasts over 7 days
